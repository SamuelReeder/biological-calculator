 * User actions are written as private inner classes that implements the

 * the ViewUserActions constructor, or else they won't be triggered by the user.
 *
 * Actions that the user can trigger are meant to manipulate some model classes
 * by sending messages to them to tell them to update their data members.
 *
 * Actions that the user can trigger can also be used to manipulate the GUI by
 * sending messages to the view classes (e.g. the DrawnView class) to tell them
 * to update themselves (e.g. to redraw themselves on the screen).
